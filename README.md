# Template-Heap-Class
Advanced C++ Coursework, Winter Quarter 2023: Templated Heap Class Implementation

## Project Overview
This repository contains a templated heap class implemented as part of my coursework in Advanced C++ during the Winter Quarter of 2023 at UCLA. The class is designed to demonstrate the use of templates in C++ for creating a versatile and reusable heap data structure.

## Description
The `Heap.h` file includes the complete implementation of the templated heap class. Key features of this class include:
- Implementation of a max heap data structure.
- Support for custom comparison functions via templates.
- Basic heap operations such as push, pop, and top.
- Utility functions for sifting elements up and down the heap.

## Usage
To use this heap class in a C++ project, include the `Heap.h` file.
